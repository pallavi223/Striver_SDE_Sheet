1. It is given that-- head is not given you are only given node which you need to delete in (question) and 
you don't have of access of first node (like head was not given)
so there is point like what uf only one node is present and you need to delete that also --> 
                                               no (in ques it is mention that you are not asked to delete last(tail) node
******************************* You need to do it in O(1) times 
 
 
void deleteNode(LinkedListNode<int> * node) {
    LinkedListNode<int> *temp = node->next;
    
    //swap values of temp and node
   node->data = node->next->data;
    node->next = node->next->next;
    temp->next = NULL;
    
}
